SYNOPSIS
      cmissh [OPTIONS] [-b script] [-e command] [URL]

DESCRIPTION
      cmissh is a command-line tool to connect to a document
      management server using the OASIS CMIS (Content Management
      Interoperability Standard) protocol.

      It can be used to create, retrieve, modify and delete
      (CRUD) document and folders.

OPTIONS
      -b script
              Enables batch mode. Runs the specified script
              non-interactively.

      -e command
              Enable command mode. Runs a single command as
              specified on the command-line.
