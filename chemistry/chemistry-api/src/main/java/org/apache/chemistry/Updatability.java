     * A read-only property is a system property that is either maintained or

     * value directly using the updateProperties() service, and often can not
     * explicitly set the property value when the object is created. In some
     * cases, an application may indirectly cause a change in the property value
     * as a result of calling a special-purpose service. For example, the
     * ParentID property of a folder object is maintained by repository. An
     * application can not alter its value using the updateProperties() service,
     * but may use the moveObject() service to cause a change in the value of
     * the ParentID property.
