Contains the JavaScript Client, Tests and Examples.

The JavaScript Client library is designed to run from the same server (URL) as 
your CMIS Server. Depending on the implementation the cmisclient.js (and the additional
html files) can be dropped into the repository and accessed with a browser.

To get started just drop all the files in the webroot in your repository and access
the index.html.
