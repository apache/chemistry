About the CMIS Python Library
=============================
The goal of this project is to create a CMIS client for Python that can be used to work with any CMIS-compliant repository.

The library is being developed with the following guidelines:
 * Developers using this API should be able to work with CMIS domain objects without having to worry about the underlying implementation details.
 * The library will use the Resftul AtomPub Binding.
 * The library will conform to the `CMIS spec <http://docs.oasisopen.org/cmis/CMIS/v1.0/cd04/cmis-spec-v1.0.pdf>`_ as closely as possible. Several public CMIS repositories are being used to test the API. 
 * The library should have no hard-coded URL's. It should be able to get everything it needs regarding how to work with the CMIS service from the CMIS service URL response and subsequent calls.
 * There shouldn't have to be a vendor-specific version of this library. The goal is for it to be interoperable with CMIS-compliant providers.

Quick Example
-------------
This should give you an idea of how easy and natural it is to work with the API:
  >>> cmisClient = CmisClient('http://localhost:8080/alfresco/s/cmis', 'admin', 'admin')
  >>> repo = cmisClient.defaultRepository
  >>> rootFolder = repo.rootFolder
  >>> children = rootFolder.getChildren()
  >>> newFolder = rootFolder.createFolder('testDeleteFolder folder')
  >>> props = newFolder.properties
  >>> newFolder.delete()
