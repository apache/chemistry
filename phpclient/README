To Run this example execute the following

php -f cmis_ls.php <rest-endpoint> <username> <password> <folderpath> [debug option 1|2]

Notes:
 + The if the folder path has spaces in it you must URL encode the folder path i.e. /Data Dictionary --> /Data+Dictionary
 + The debug option can be omitted. If it is 1 the program will display all of the arrays associated with the objects that
   are returned.  If the debug option is 2 or more, then the XML returned will also be displayed
 + This will not work on Pre CMIS-1.0 repositories
 + There is virtually no error checking.
 + Your version of php must support DOMDocument and curl

Example Runs
php -f cmis_ls.php   http://cmis.alfresco.com/service/api/cmis  admin admin /
php -f cmis_ls.php   http://cmis.alfresco.com/service/api/cmis  admin admin /Data+Dictionary 1


The cmis_repository_wrapper.php library provided the following functionality
+ Encapsulates access to a CMIS 1.0 compliant repository
+ Provides utilities for getting information out of:
  + Workspace (the repositoryInfo)
  + Object Entries
  + Non-Hierarchical Object feeds
