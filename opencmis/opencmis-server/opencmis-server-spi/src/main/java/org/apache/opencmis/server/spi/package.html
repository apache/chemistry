Provides interfaces and classes for CMIS repository connectors.

<h2>Entry point</h2>

<p>A repository connector has to extend the {@link
org.apache.opencmis.server.spi.AbstractServicesFactory
AbstractServicesFactory} class. This class manages the objects that
implement the interfaces of the different CMIS services. There is only
one active instance of this class per servlet context.</p>
<p>The class name has to be set in the configuration file <code>/WEB-INF/classes/repository.properties</code>
(<code>class=...</code>). The configuration file can contain more
key-value pairs. They are passed to the {@link
org.apache.opencmis.server.spi.AbstractServicesFactory#init init()}
method when the servlet context starts up.</p>

<h2>Common operation patterns</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The operations take the same parameters as described in the
	CMIS specification. There are a few exceptions that are explained in
	this JavaDoc.</li>

	<li>The first parameter for all operations is a {@link
	org.apache.opencmis.server.spi.CallContext CallContext} object. It is
	used to transport authentication information to the connector.</li>

	<li>Some operations have an additional {@link
	org.apache.opencmis.server.spi.ObjectInfoHolder ObjectInfoHolder}
	parameter. This object is only set if the call is an AtomPub call.
	AtomPub entries and feeds require additional data about the objects
	that should be returned AND the object that has been passed. In case of
	a {@link
	org.apache.opencmis.server.spi.CmisNavigationService#getChildren
	getChildren()} call, for example, data about the children AND the
	folder itself would be required. {@link
	org.apache.opencmis.server.spi.ObjectInfoHolder ObjectInfoHolder}
	collects {@link org.apache.opencmis.server.spi.ObjectInfo ObjectInfo}
	objects.</li>
</ul>
