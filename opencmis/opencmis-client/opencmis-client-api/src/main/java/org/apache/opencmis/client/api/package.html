The OpenCMIS Client API.
<p>
This package provides interfaces and classes for accessing CMIS repositories
via an object oriented API.
<br/>
Interfaces in this package are implemented by the OpenCMIS runtime and must not be
implemented by applications.
The OpenCMIS client API depends on the OpenCMIS commons API. 
</p>
<p>
To use the OpenCMIS client API, a client needs to get a reference to the entry interface
{@link org.opencmis.client.api.SessionFactory} and then connect to the CMIS repository
by obtaining a session to the repository from  the {@code SessionFactory}.
The way to get an instance of a {@code SessionFactory} depends on the clients runtime:
Usually this will be done via JNDI lookup in a J2E runtime or a service lookup in a OSGi Runtime.
</p>
<p>
Note: A session is not thread-safe, thus either multiple sessions should be used or some
kind of synchronization has to be used. <br/>
All operations that require a round-trip to the back-end will do that synchronously,
causing the client to be blocked during that call.</p>

<h2>Usage of the API</h2>
<p>
The following example code illustrates how the session is obtained, used and finally released.
<pre>
  SessionFactory factory;
  Session session;
  try {
    // acquire the session factory  
    factory = (SessionFactory) new InitialContext().lookup(JNDI_LOOKUP_KEY);
    // provide some basic configuration
    HashMap parameters = new HashMap();
    parameters.put(SessionParameter.USER, "user");
    parameters.put(SessionParamter.PASSWORD, encode("password"));
    parameters.put(SessionParameter.URL, "http://server:port/path");
    // get the session
    session = factory.getSession(parameters);
    // sample: get the root folder and create a new top-level folder
    Folder rootFolder = session.getRootFolder();
    Document document = session.getObjectFactory().createDocument(rootFolder, "test");
    document.setProperty("myProperty", "stringpropertyvalue");
    document.save(); // create document with property
  } // end try
  finally {
    //cleanup
  }    
</pre>
