The OpenCMIS Client API.
<p>
This package provides interfaces and classes for accessing CMIS repositories
via an object oriented API.
<br/>
Interfaces in this package are implemented by the OpenCMIS runtime and must not be
implemented by applications.
The OpenCMIS client API depends on the OpenCMIS commons API. 
</p>
<p>
To use the OpenCMIS client API, a client needs to get a reference to the entry interface
{@link org.opencmis.client.api.SessionFactory} and then connect to the CMIS repository
by obtaining a session to the repository from  the {@code SessionFactory}.
The way to get an instance of a {@code SessionFactory} depends on the clients runtime:
Usually this will be done via JNDI lookup in a J2E runtime or a service lookup in a OSGi Runtime.
</p>
<p>
Note: A session is not thread-safe, thus either multiple sessions should be used or some
kind of synchronization has to be used. <br/>
All operations that require a round-trip to the back-end will do that synchronously,
causing the client to be blocked during that call.</p>
